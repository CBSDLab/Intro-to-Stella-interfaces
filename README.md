# Introduction and examples of Stella online interfaces to models

Stella simulation models can include an online interface that can be published and hosted on [isee Exchange](https://exchange.iseesystems.com/) at no cost for public models. Creating and deploying an interface is relatively easy are requires no formal training in system dynamics or HTML programming as Stella Designer for developing interfaces (included with Stella Architect) is point-and-click. 

* Create an interface to present simulation results from a model for a journal publication. Here's an [example](https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/psh/developmental-transitions-and-cognitive-vulnerability/index.html#page1) where reviewers could interact with the model and replicate the results presented in the paper. 
* Illustrate dynamic spatial relationships using GIS shapefiles. Here's an [example](https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/psh/hei-demo/index.html#page1) of a simulation model of regional health equity for Cuyahoga County.
* Use a model in academic presentations to community a "proof of concept" model to colleagues. Here's an [example](https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/psh/bettr/index.html#page1) of a model used by the PI to community the core idea behind their transdisciplinary research.   
* Use an interface to create a **truly** interactive poster session. Here's an [example](https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/psh/human-resiliency/index.html#page1) of an interface presented as an interactive poster allowing users to explore scenarios and different combinations of interventions. 
* Provide a platform for stakeholders to explore implications of policies. Here's an [example](https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/psh/relationship-and-sexual-violence/index.html#page1) of an interface exploring different campus sexual assault prevention and intervention strategies.  
* Develop a prototype multiplayer interactive game for workshops, e.g., for raising awareness and providing tools for addressing collective action problems.
